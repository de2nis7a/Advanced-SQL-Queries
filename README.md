# üß† Advanced SQL Query Portfolio (PostgreSQL)

A technical collection of advanced SQL queries showcasing deep understanding of relational databases, data analysis, and performance optimization in PostgreSQL.

---

## üéØ Overview

This repository features over **50 advanced SQL queries**, each designed to demonstrate real-world data analysis and manipulation skills.  
The goal is to show how complex business questions can be translated into efficient, readable, and accurate SQL statements.

All examples are built for a simulated **University Library Management System** ‚Äî a realistic, relational environment including:

- `Students`, `Courses`
- `Books`, `Authors`, `Publishers`
- `Genres`, `Languages`
- `Loans`, `Librarians`, and `Inventory`

This structure provides a robust testbed for exploring multi-table joins, aggregations, and analytical queries.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

Queries are organized by technical theme for clarity and progression:

- **[Joins](./Joins)** ‚Üí Combining multiple tables with `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL JOIN`.
- **[DataFilteringAndSelection](./DataFilteringAndSelection)** ‚Üí Logical filtering using `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `IN`, and `BETWEEN`.
- **[AggregationAndSetOperations](./AggregationAndSetOperations)** ‚Üí Use of `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and set operations like `UNION` and `INTERSECT`.
- **[OuterJoinsAndNullHandling](./OuterJoinsAndNullHandling)** ‚Üí Managing incomplete data with `LEFT JOIN`, `COALESCE`, and `IS NULL`.
- **[AdvancedAggregationAndWindowFunctions](./AdvancedAggregationAndWindowFunctions)** ‚Üí Window functions (`OVER()`, `PARTITION BY`) for rankings, cumulative totals, and percentages.
- **[Subqueries](./Subqueries)** ‚Üí Correlated and non-correlated subqueries within `WHERE`, `HAVING`, and `JOIN` clauses.
- **[ViewsAndIndexing](./ViewsAndIndexing)** ‚Üí Creating reusable `VIEW`s and optimizing query performance with `CREATE INDEX` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
